# 🔧 Routing Fixes - Admin Dashboard Navigation

## ✅ What Has Been Fixed

Fixed the navigation issues in the admin dashboard where clicking on menu items didn't show any views.

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Router Configuration** (`client/src/router/index.ts`)

Added 4 new routes:

```typescript
// Enhanced Admin Dashboard (replaced old one)
{
  path: '/admin/dashboard',
  name: 'AdminDashboard',
  component: () => import('@/pages/EnhancedAdminDashboard.vue'),
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, role: 'admin' },
}

// Pending Users Page
{
  path: '/admin/pending-users',
  name: 'PendingUsers',
  component: () => import('@/pages/PendingUsersPage.vue'),
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, role: 'admin' },
}

// Leave Types Management Page
{
  path: '/admin/leave-types',
  name: 'LeaveTypes',
  component: () => import('@/pages/LeaveTypesPage.vue'),
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, role: 'admin' },
}

// Department View Page (dynamic route)
{
  path: '/admin/department/:department',
  name: 'DepartmentView',
  component: () => import('@/pages/DepartmentViewPage.vue'),
  props: true,
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, role: 'admin' },
}
```
