## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Run: `cd server && npm run seed:leave-types`
- [ ] Verify 5 leave types created
- [ ] Test: POST /api/auth/register (no password)
- [ ] Test: GET /api/users/pending
- [ ] Test: POST /api/users/:id/approve
- [ ] Test: GET /api/leave-types
- [ ] Test: GET /api/users/departments

- [ ] Department menu populates
- [ ] Department view loads
- [ ] Admin dashboard tabs work

## ðŸ’¡ Tips & Tricks

### For Development:
1. **Use Mock Mode:** Set `USE_MOCK_API: true` in `app.config.ts` for frontend-only development
2. **Hot Reload:** Both frontend and backend support hot reload
3. **Console Logs:** Check browser console for API errors

### For Testing:
1. **Seed Data:** Always run `npm run seed:leave-types` first
2. **Admin Account:** Use existing admin from seed script
3. **Test Users:** Create test users with different departments

### For Debugging:
1. **Network Tab:** Check API calls in browser DevTools
2. **Vue DevTools:** Install for component inspection
3. **Backend Logs:** Check terminal for server errors

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@/api/userManagement'"
**Solution:** TypeScript errors will resolve after `npm install`

### Issue: Leave types not showing
**Solution:** Run `npm run seed:leave-types` in server directory

### Issue: Pending users not appearing
**Solution:** Check user's `approvalStatus` is "pending" in database

### Issue: Department menu empty
**Solution:** Ensure users have `department` field populated

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps

### To Complete:
1. Update Register page (remove password field)
2. Update ApplyLeave form (add leave type selector, paid/unpaid)
3. Create routes for new pages
4. Update mock data with new fields
5. Test end-to-end flows

### Future Enhancements:
- Email notifications on approval
- Password reset functionality
- Leave type usage reports
- Department-wise analytics
- Export leave data to CSV
